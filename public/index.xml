      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve held a variety of roles at organizations of different sizes, but by far the most success I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced is in the environment of an early-stage, fast-growing startup company. It&amp;rsquo;s an exciting place to operate, the momentum and fast pace feels amazing to be around. The sense of progress and &amp;ldquo;building something&amp;rdquo; is palpable, optimism is in the air.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, like all things in life, there&amp;rsquo;s a trade-off. A fast pace means high pressure. Momentum means higher expectations. Excitement also means uncertainty. Potential for huge wins necessarily means potential for huge loss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT has people very excited. Academics are imagining their hard-wrought papers being generated with a simple prompt. Programmers are watching machines begin to write their own code. Writers and creatives are staring at the results of a ChatGPT prompt with amazement, delight, and terror.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AI has arrived. Not the way that Hollywood said it would, but in the way that all magnificent human inventions happen: gradually, over time, with the participation of countless individuals. We did it. We can&amp;rsquo;t put the genie back in the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
