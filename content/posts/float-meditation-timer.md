I built a meditation timer app called
[Float](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/float-meditation-timer/id6757253072). It's
on the App Store now, and it's free.

Why build yet another meditation app? Honestly, I just wanted
something simple. Every meditation app I tried came loaded with guided
sessions, subscription upsells, social features, achievement
badges. This stuff seems antithetical to the whole point of sitting
quietly for a few minutes.

Float does three things:

1. Sets a timer
2. Plays a gentle sound when you're done
3. Logs your minutes to Apple Health

That's it. No accounts, no subscriptions, no daily streaks
guilt-tripping you. No notifications pestering you to meditate. No
gamification, no ads, no in-app purchases. Just a timer.

I also wanted to experiment with Apple's new Liquid Glass design
language, and a meditation timer seemed like the perfect canvas for
it. The result is an interface that feels calm and intuitive—exactly
what you want when you're about to close your eyes.

It's free, and it'll stay free. [Give it a
try](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/float-meditation-timer/id6757253072)
if you're looking for something minimal.
