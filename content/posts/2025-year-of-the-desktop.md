The year: 2025. The situation: installing Linux on a desktop computer. The expectations: high. The result: utter disappointment.

No disrespect to the incredibly talented and hardworking folks who have created and continue to maintain Linux. It's truly a modern wonder of the world, that a free and open-source operating system of such high quality exists. I use it everywhere on the server. Linux runs on everything from toasters to spaceships.

But I can't even express my level of disappointment that in 2025, after booting up a fresh install of Arch Linux on my 5-year-old Intel + Nvidia desktop, the screen randomly goes black. It's just flickering back and forth endlessly. I still need to drop in virtual console and parse through the `systemd` journal to figure out why.

I can love something and hate it too.
