You can’t pick yourself up from failure if you never truly tried.

We learn from failure. Real failure. Where you tried so hard, the
hardest you could, and you **still** failed. If we half-ass something,
and fail, we have an excuse: didn’t try. If we succeed, we reinforce
that it’s acceptable to half-ass things. Either way we learn the wrong
lesson.

I get it. Things are scary, and failure hurts. Trying hard and not
achieving your goal comes with crushing disappointment. But the key is
to suffer through that and grow from it. That’s how you get
better. Trying hard means _necessarily_ that you will fail. Failure is
the `yin` to trying hard's `yang`. In the wise words of my father, "You
ain't skiing unless you're falling."

We lie to ourselves all the time about how hard we tried. If you find
yourself pointing to external validation (success, money, praise)
that’s a red flag that you probably don’t try that hard. Real effort
is its own validation. If you don’t know deep down that you gave it
your all, then you probably didn’t.

We have endless excuses for why we didn’t try hard. Some of them are
important: injury is a good excuse not to push for a personal
best. Don’t be stupid. But also, don’t lie to yourself. Underneath
these excuses is a simple emotion: fear. It almost goes without saying
that facing your fears is the only way to grow.

Try hard. Revel in the failure, knowing you gave it your all. Failure
doesn't mean you suck, _never_ failing means you suck. Nobody will
push you harder than you can push yourself. You're stronger than you
think.
