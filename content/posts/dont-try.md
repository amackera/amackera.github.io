On Charles Bukowski's gravestone is inscribed the epitaph "Don't
Try". This deceptively simple phrase lives rent-free in my brain. It's
a beautiful encapsulation of an incredibly important concept. 

We learn and grow from failure. Real failure. Times where you gave
every ounce of yourself, pushing as hard as you could, and you
**still** failed. At the very least, you learned what not to do. And
usually, you develop a clear vision for what to do differently next
time. "Don't Try" doesn't mean don't work, it means don't lie to
yourself about whether you did.

In contrast, when we half-ass things, no healthy learning or growth
_ever_ happens. If we tried a thing and failed, we have the excuse
that we "didn’t _really_ try". When we succeed, we learn that it’s ok
to half-ass things. Either way, we reinforce the wrong lessons.

Putting yourself out there and not achieving your goal comes with
crushing disappointment. The key is to suffer through that and grow
from it. That’s how you get better. Trying hard means _necessarily_
that you will fail. Failure is the `yin` to trying hard's `yang`. In
the wise words of my father: "You ain't skiing until you're falling."

If you find yourself craving external validation (success, money,
praise) that’s a red flag that you're probably doing it wrong. Real
effort is its own validation. If you don’t know, deep down, that you
gave it your all, then you probably didn’t. Hard work *is* good work.

The reason this works is not because hard work is some kind of
mystical Aristotelian virtue signaling. It works because putting your
entire self into a thing is scary. Growth comes through facing your
fears and conquering them. Even if you fail to capture the keep,
bucking up the courage to storm the gates is the real
victory. Overcoming your fear reinforces your self-mastery, and it
feels amazing.

And so we return to Bukowski's wise words: "Don't Try." Bukowski
didn't have an easy ride to success. After half a lifetime of
rejection, at age 49 he finally received a meagre offer to
write for Black Sparrow Press for $100 per month. On the choice of
whether to accept the offer, he wrote:

> I have one of two choices — stay in the post office and go crazy
> ... or stay out here and play at writer and starve. I have decided
> to starve.

From that point on he published all of his remaining work through
Black Sparrow, as gratitude for their faith in him.

Bukowski's own thoughts on "working hard" are more nuanced than I've
represented here. He wasn't necessarily advocating the importance of
hard work or the value in failure. He was an advocate of patience and
truth. In one of Bukowski's more famous poems, _so you want to be a
writer?_, he wrote:

> if you have to wait for it to roar out of
> you,
> then wait patiently.
> if it never does roar out of you,
> do something else.

Be patient. Don't force it. But when you get the choice, choose to
starve.
