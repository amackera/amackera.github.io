I often want to share small bits of code that are clean, syntax
highlighted, and ready for a blog post or a quick message to a
friend. There are plenty of tools for this, but none with the tight
editor integration I wanted.

So, I built one: [Shotify](https://shotify.codes).

Here's what it produces:

Shotify currently supports Emacs (my baby), VS Code, Neovim, and the
CLI, and is available as an `npm` package for integrating into your own
tools.

This is an early release. Feedback and contributions are welcome in
the [`shotify`](https://github.com/amackera/shotify) Github repo.
