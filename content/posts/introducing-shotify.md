I sometimes find myself wanting to take a nicely formatted,
syntax-highlighted, and share-ready screenshots of some code I'm
working on. There are a bunch of tools that exist already for this,
but none with nice tight editor integration that I was looing for.

So, I made my own: [Shotify](https://shotify.codes). Take a
look:

Right now it supports Emacs (my baby), VSCode, CLI, and it's available
as an `npm` package for you to integrate into your own projects.

This is the very early version, so feel free to get involved in the
[`shotify`](https://github.com/amackera/shotify) Github project if you
have any feedback.
