The year: 2026. The situation: installing Linux on a desktop
computer. The expectations: high. The result: utter disappointment.

No disrespect to the incredibly talented and hardworking folks who
have created and continue to maintain Linux. It's truly a modern
wonder of the world that a free and open-source operating system of
such high quality exists. It's ubiquitous on the server. Linux runs on
everything from toasters to spaceships.

But I can't even express my level of disappointment that in 2026,
after booting up a fresh install of Arch Linux on my 5-year-old
Intel + Nvidia desktop, the screen randomly goes black. It's just
flickering back and forth endlessly. I drop into a virtual console
and parse through the `systemd` journal to figure out why.

Hours of troubleshooting later, I give up and order an AMD graphics
card. Pop it in, reboot, and everything just works. The Nvidia
driver situation on Linux has been a disaster for two decades, and
apparently it still is. Lesson learned (again).

But here's the thing: I'll keep trying. I've been running Linux on
the desktop since 2005. My first install was on an old white MacBook,
back when that required actual courage. I ran a beautifully stable
setup on a ThinkPad for years. And now, after the requisite futzing,
my 2026 desktop build is rock solid.

And here's the real twist: I've been using Linux on the desktop every
single day without even thinking about it. My Steam Deck runs Linux.
It plays my entire game library, suspends and resumes flawlessly, and
has never once flickered at me. Valve did what twenty years of "year
of the Linux desktop" predictions couldn't: they shipped a Linux
desktop that regular people actually use.

Meanwhile, I boot my Windows PC once a month, just long enough to
update everything, and then shut it back down.

I can love something and hate it too. See you next year.
