I am a software creator with experience building systems that operate
reliably under inherently unreliable conditions.

Throughout my career, I've worked on high scale web services in a
variety of critical domains, notably education, legal, finance, and
enterprise support. Previously, I ran engineering and technology at
[Ada](https://ada.cx), [LegalMate](https://legalmate.co), and [Top
Hat](https://tophat.com).

My expertise lies in developing reliable software services deployed at
scale via cloud infrastructure. This includes deployments of
transactional systems, "real-time" web systems, online ML models,
high-scale batch processing, and most recently [re-entrant
processes](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Reentrancy_(computing)),
and durable execution.

Over the last 25+ years, I've shipped code in almost a dozen
programming languages, worked with some truly exceptional people,
built software that's been downloaded billions of times, and had a
absolute blast.
