I create software systems that operate reliably under unreliable
conditions.

I've led engineering teams and built large-scale services in critical
domains including climate tech, education, legal, finance, and
enterprise support. Previous roles include Head of Engineering at
[Mangrove Systems](https://mangrovesystems.com) and
[Ada](https://ada.cx), CTO at [LegalMate](https://legalmate.co), and
Chief Architect and VP Technology at [Top Hat](https://tophat.com).

My expertise is in designing and deploying scalable, fault-tolerant
cloud services: transactional and real-time web systems, online
ML models, high-throughput batch pipelines, and durable execution.

A University of Waterloo ECE graduate, I've since relocated to
Vancouver on Canada's west coast. Over the last 15+ years, I've
shipped code in almost a dozen programming languages, worked with some
exceptional people, and shipped software that's used by millions
worldwide.
